            <h3>Drafting</h3>
            <p>
                Be part of one of the 8 competing teams of carefully handpicked
                players. I (marco) will do all the teams drafting with the
                following in mind. The goal is to have the best possible balance
                between all 8 teams for which reason I try to evaluate all
                participating player's skill level and try matching them all up
                perfectly. I myself will not be participating and will enjoy my
                time with making a fortune on the infamous illegal dystopia
                gambling scene instead. I have been playing this game for the
                better part of my gaming career and know almost every active
                player, their favorite weapons, playstyles and most importantly,
                their skill. I might record the drafting process and upload that
                if anybody is interested in my thought process.
            </p>
            <h3>Match days and time</h3>
            <p>
                Match days will be predetermined and shown in the
                dates-and-results tournament tree. There are 8 match days in
                total which are held on Saturdays (12.6., 19.6., 26.6., 3.7.,
                10.7., 17.7., 24.7., 31.7.). CHECK THIS BEFORE YOU SIGN UP! If
                you drop out early you obviously don't have to play on all these
                dates. Substitutes are hopefully there to jump in in a pinch too
                in case somebody misses a match day. Match times will be 17:30
                UTC (19:30 CEST) for the first match of the evening and 19:00
                UTC (21:00 CEST) for the second match of the evening (that's the
                western European timezone, including Switzerland). I set the
                times to later on the evening so hopefully a couple US players
                can play too! The games will be played on a server in the region
                from which the most players of that match are from. This will be
                announced one week in advance. Thank you Karl of Duty for
                letting us use one of your EU servers! Thank you Team Epic for
                letting us use their US server!

                the signup channel and use the example given at the very top of
                said channel. I need this information for drafting.
                [Participation Type] We need both players and substitute
                players. Please mention for which you want to sign up. You can
                sign up for both and will be substitute if not drafted (if you
                get drafted you can't be substitute). - Player Please mention if
                you want to sign up as a draftable player. - Substitute WE NEED
                substitutes from all timezones and skill ranges to ensure a
                smooth tournament. Please consider helping out with signing up
                as a substitute player and you will have my eternal gratitude!

                DISCLAIMERS below!
            </p>
            <h3>Substitutes</h3>
            <p>
                This tournament will run over 8 predetermined match days so it
                is possible that not all players who need to play are available.
                For that reason we want to have a pool of substitutes. These
                substitutes will be picked for you according to the skill level
                of the player they are replacing. If any of your players can't
                play on one of your match days, please contact me so I can
                organize somebody for you. TO ALL SUBSTITUTES: Please read the
                DISCLAIMER below about the price pool carefully.
            </p>
            <h3>Winning a match</h3>
            <p>
                One match is 2 full rounds of 20 minutes each, with each team
                once on the attacking and once on the defending side. A team
                wins a match in one of the following situations: - It achieved
                more Objective-Captures on the attacking side (not the amount
                but the progress) - If both teams have the same amount of
                Objective-Captures, then whoever has the fastest capture of the
                most advanced objective wins - If no objectives have been
                captured on both sides then the team that gathered the most
                score over their entire team of 5 wins marco — 04/26/2021

            <h3>Most importantly</h3>
            <p>
                This is for us to have FUN first and foremost! I am doing this
                for the first time and if I forgot to write down anything or
                can't draft you this time or mistreat you in any other way
                (other than zapping ya with the laser of course), don't get
                pissed! Let us have a fun tournament instead! We probably don't
                even need a price pool but it get's just that little bit more
                exciting if there is one.

            <h3>Disclaimer</h3>
            <p>
                I Love this game and wanted to have a fun tournament for the
                community. To ensure everybody is having fun, I came up with
                this drafting system and also thought about putting in some
                money for a decent price pool. Following are a couple
                disclaimers: [GENERAL] o There is no guarantee that you get
                drafted if you sign up as with only 8 teams there are only 40
                fixed player slots. Furthermore, I am trying to draft the most
                balanced teams I can. No first come first serve. o The signup
                channel can get closed down at any time depending on the amount
                of players signing up. I don't know what the actual demand for
                this is so it's hard to plan ahead. o I am putting in my own
                money for the price pool and this is for the DRAFTED five
                players in the winning team only (gets too complicated with
                substitutes). If you have to use substitutes, then these players
                (subs) are just coming in to help out and do not get any of the
                price money in case the team they helped out wins. Substitute
                players are kind of part of the staff and ensure a smooth
                tournament. WE LOVE YOU SUBS! ❤️ [SUBSTITUTES & ATTENDANCE] o
                SIGN-UP ONLY IF INTENDING TO PLAY: If anybody signs up and gets
                drafted and then doesn't show up and it's clear they don't have
                an acceptable excuse and have to be replaced with substitutes in
                MORE THAN 2 GAMES, then they are not eligible for the price
                money. o If you need to use a substitute, please give advanced
                notice as soon as possible so we can organize a substitute
                player. If worst comes to worst and we can't find anybody
                willing to help you out, you have to play with whoever is
                present of your team or forfeit. o If your team is not ready by
                the time the game is supposed to beginn, you have to play with
                what players are present or can take a loss instead. If your
                missing players arrive later, they can join midgame. If you used
                a substitute, the late player cannot join a running game and
                switch with the substitute.
